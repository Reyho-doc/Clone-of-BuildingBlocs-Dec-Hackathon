## ⚠️ Video Playback Issue (Do NOT lauch this site on github)

Some videos in this project **may not play directly on GitHub**.

### How to view the videos
1. **Download the video via google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oZnvkuC7XHb0-n90G9Zkyn5YsOmTfSMz?usp=sharing)  to your computer**  
2. **Download the repository to your computer and unzip it (if needed)**
3. **Replace the (videos) file in the repository (that you have downloaded) with the (videos) file from the google drive**
---

If you encounter missing or non-working video previews, this is normal due to GitHub's limitations (or my videos are corrupted).

## Running the code

After doing the videos downloading step in (⚠️ Video Playback Issue), run the code(index.html) using live server


- The main page includes the storyline of events (just scroll, no extra controls required)
- Character page has a slider animation as well as a carousel.
- The game consists of 3 different avengers you can pick from, and a villian as the second player (This is a TWO player game)
if you defeat the villian (you win), if not, you lose
